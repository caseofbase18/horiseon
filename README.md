# horiseon
I used semantic HTML5 in place of other tags.  I managed to change all of the tags.  I consolidated the CSS where possible and reordered the CSS as necessary to match the layout of the HTML.  I also left helpful comments.  I ensured that all of the features work and corrected the features that were malfunctioning.  I also ensured that the layout remained the same as before.
